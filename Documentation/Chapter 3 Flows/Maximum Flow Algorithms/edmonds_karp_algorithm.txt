Edmonds-Karp Algorithm 

Definition -
Edmonds-Karp Algorithm is one variation of the Ford-Fulkersron Algorithm. 
The Edmonds-Karp Algorithm finds the augmenting path using breadth first search. 
If there exists multiple augmenting paths from source to destination then ford-fulkerson algorithm choses
the path with the least length. 
This way of choosing the augmenting path proves to be very beneficial, as it limits the time complexity of the algorithm 
to O(V*E*E).Hence the time complexity is independent of the value of the max flow. 
Hence if a graph has large flow value but the number of vertices and edges are small, then this algorithm offers 
a significant improvement.
